A new translation feature automatically translates any text in a design to over 100 different languages, and video footage can be matched up to the beat of a soundtrack without any manual edits. Canva said that it uses a mix of different AI models as the foundation for these features in addition to building its own systems. Finally, 953 new fonts and a host of non-workspace-specific tools are being added to the design platform that have been requested by its wider community. New editing features for layouts, layers, styles, and gradients are available to jazz up your designs, and alt text can now be generated for images directly within Canva.
